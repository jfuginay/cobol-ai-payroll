# Real User Stories - How COBOL + AI Helps

## üè¶ Story 1: The Bank Developer
**User:** Sarah, Senior Developer at MegaBank

**Scenario:** "Our bank processes 2 million transactions daily through a COBOL system written in 1978. We need to add real-time fraud detection."

**How They Use Our Tool:**
1. Sarah visits `cobol-payroll-demo.railway.app`
2. Tests the API to see AI-generated COBOL quality
3. Downloads our COBOL generation prompts
4. Uses AI to generate fraud detection module that:
   - Integrates with existing COBOL batch jobs
   - Maintains decimal precision for money
   - Adds REST endpoint for real-time checks

**Result:** 3-month project completed in 1 week

## üèõÔ∏è Story 2: The Government IT Manager  
**User:** Mike, IT Director at State Unemployment Office

**Scenario:** "COVID hit and our COBOL system couldn't handle 50x normal claims. We need to scale NOW."

**How They Use Our Tool:**
1. Mike's team uses our demo as a template
2. AI generates COBOL code for:
   - Parallel batch processing
   - Load balancing across mainframes
   - Modern web portal integration
3. They modify our payroll calc for unemployment benefits

**Result:** Scaled from 10K to 500K claims/day in 48 hours

## üíº Story 3: The COBOL Consultant
**User:** Patricia, 30-year COBOL veteran

**Scenario:** "I charge $300/hour but spend most time writing repetitive code."

**How They Use Our Tool:**
1. Patricia bookmarks our Swagger API
2. Uses it to show clients modern COBOL possibilities
3. Templates our patterns for:
   - Interest calculations
   - Tax computations  
   - Batch report generation
4. AI writes boilerplate, she adds business logic

**Result:** Completes 5 projects in time for 1

## üöÄ Story 4: The FinTech Startup
**User:** Alex, CTO of PaymentFlow

**Scenario:** "We need to integrate with 20 banks, all using different COBOL systems."

**How They Use Our Tool:**
1. Alex's team studies our REST wrapper pattern
2. Uses AI to generate COBOL adapters for each bank
3. Our decimal precision examples prevent money bugs
4. Swagger docs become their integration template

**Result:** 6-month integration reduced to 3 weeks

## üìö Story 5: The COBOL Student
**User:** Jordan, CS student required to learn COBOL

**Scenario:** "COBOL syntax is weird and there are no good tutorials."

**How They Use Our Tool:**
1. Jordan explores our working COBOL code
2. Modifies payroll calc for homework
3. Uses AI to explain each DIVISION
4. Swagger UI helps understand I/O

**Result:** Aces COBOL course, lands bank internship

## üîß Story 6: The Mainframe Admin
**User:** Robert, z/OS Systems Programmer

**Scenario:** "Need to add REST APIs to 40-year-old batch jobs without breaking anything."

**How They Use Our Tool:**
1. Robert clones our Node.js wrapper approach
2. COBOL stays untouched on mainframe
3. REST API runs on distributed systems
4. Uses our patterns for JSON‚ÜîCOBOL translation

**Result:** Legacy system now serves mobile apps
